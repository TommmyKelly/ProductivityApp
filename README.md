# ProductivityApp

An app with a couple of boards that includes a calander, notes board with html markdown, stopper to make sure that you get up from that sit every once in a while and more on the way.

The design will be similar to trello and kinda figmatic. Since I'm not a designer, I can't really create a good design so you are free to design however you like. 
This is a React practice app so we don't need to make it look the best.
We'll try to keep it professioanl just to feel like it's a real life project

```App
|__NavigationBar
|  |__Logo
|  |__NavigationLinks
|     |__NavigationLink
|
|__NoteBoard
| |__Notes
| |   |__Note
| |     |__Text
| |__NoteForm
| |  |__Input
| |__AddNoteButton
|
|__CalanderBoard
|   |__Have no idea rn
|
|__StopperBoard
    |__Have no idea rn```
    
First we'll start by working on the notes board and navigation
